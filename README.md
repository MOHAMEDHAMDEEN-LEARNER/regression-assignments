# 📊 Machine Learning Assignment: Regression

## 📝 Overview

This repository contains the code and materials for my **Machine Learning Assignment** on **Regression**, completed as part of the **PW Skills Data Science Course**. The main objective of this assignment is to implement and understand various regression techniques and their applications in predicting continuous variables.

## 📚 Contents

- **`data/`**: Dataset(s) used for training and testing the regression models.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing code, analysis, and results.
- **`models/`**: Serialized models used for making predictions.
- **`outputs/`**: Model performance metrics and visualizations.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## 📈 Problem Statement

The task is to build regression models to predict a target variable from a given dataset. The assignment involves applying different regression techniques, comparing their performances, and drawing insights from the results.

### Models Used

- **Simple Linear Regression**: A foundational technique to model the relationship between two variables.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: A model that accounts for multiple input features.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Extends linear regression to capture nonlinear relationships.
- **Ridge Regression**: A regularization technique to handle multicollinearity.
- **Lasso Regression**: Helps with feature selection by reducing less important feature coefficients to zero.

## 🎯 Objective

The key objectives of the assignment include:

- Gaining an understanding of various regression models.
- Learning how to preprocess data for regression tasks.
- Building models to predict continuous outcomes.
- Evaluating the models using appropriate performance metrics.

## ⚙️ Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.
  
2. **Model Training**: 
   - Training different regression models and understanding their underlying assumptions.
  
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Evaluating the models using metrics like:
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** 📉
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** 🔍
     - **R-Squared (R²)** 💡

4. **Model Tuning**:
   - Experimenting with hyperparameter tuning for ridge and lasso regression to improve performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 📊
- **NumPy** 🔢
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** 📈 (for visualizations)
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖 (for regression models)

## 📊 Results

The performance of each regression model is compared based on the evaluation metrics. Insights on which models perform best under different conditions and datasets are discussed in the notebook.

## 🔗 How to Run
